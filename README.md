Smarter Shelf
=============

This project is about a grocery shopping that helps shoppers to compare items with enlarged, focused item information on the display shelves in terms of a specific category and easily change the categories from one to the next just by a waving hand. No more have to inspect the information at the back of items in small letters. Shoppers can make decisions based on preferred category at a glance and save time!

We are using C++ and <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/" target="_blank">openFrameworks</a> to display information on the shelves, Arduino with <a href="http://www.sparkfun.com/products/8958">Infrared Proximity Sensor</a> to recognize user's hand gesture to choose category and <a href="http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/Firmata" target="_blank">Firmata</a> for communicating between Arduino and openFrameworks.
